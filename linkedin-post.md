🚀 **Excited to share my first open-source contribution to the Claude Code ecosystem!**

I just released the **Enhanced Status Line Plugin** for Claude Code CLI - a beautiful, informative status line that transforms your development experience with real-time insights.

## 🎯 What it does:

Instead of just seeing basic info, you now get:

📁 **Current directory** - Know where you are
⎇ **Git status** - Branch name, uncommitted changes (*), unpushed commits (↑N)
◉ **Smart context tracking** - Token usage with color-coded warnings
⏱️ **Session duration** - Track your productivity
+/- **Code changes** - Lines added/removed in real-time
💰 **Cost monitoring** - Keep track of API costs

## 💡 Why I built this:

As a developer using Claude Code daily, I wanted more visibility into my sessions. The default status line was functional but lacked the detailed metrics I needed to optimize my workflow and manage context usage effectively.

## ✨ Features that stand out:

✅ Color-coded context warnings (Green → Yellow → Orange)
✅ Real token count display (not just percentages)
✅ Git integration with unpushed commit counter
✅ Fully customizable with 256 terminal colors
✅ Zero configuration after installation
✅ Open source and free to use

## 🔧 Installation:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add deepan-g2/claude-statusline-plugin
/plugin install enhanced-statusline@deepan-g2/claude-statusline-plugin
```

## 🌟 What's next:

This is just v1.0.0! I'm planning to add:
- Multiple theme presets (Dracula, Nord, Cyberpunk)
- Custom metric display options
- Performance indicators
- Team collaboration features

Would love to hear your feedback and feature suggestions! If you're using Claude Code, give it a try and let me know what you think. 💬

Special thanks to the amazing Claude Code team at @Anthropic for building such an extensible platform! 🙌
